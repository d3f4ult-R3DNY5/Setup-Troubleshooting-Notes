# Setup-Troubleshooting-Notes
This repo is where I keep everything I did while setting up different tools, environments, and projects. It includes installation steps, configs, common errors I ran into, and how I fixed them. The goal is to make setups repeatable and troubleshooting faster â€” both for me and anyone working on similar stuff.
